            <p style="text-align: justify;">These days, design is more than a selling point: it’s a requirement. This is especially true within highly competitive fields such as Web Application and Software Development. Startups are battling it out for the public’s attention, and the audience just keeps getting more demanding. A website presenting a new web application must at once clearly explain its product while proving its relevance. In this context, design is the key to creating an efficient website that is both informative and enticing.

              Consequently, for a website developer in need of inspiration, this field is a goldmine. That’s why we chose to curate a list of the most beautiful websites built for application and software startups. Our team has chosen these websites based on the quality and originality of the design and navigation. We have featured young but flourishing companies, some more mature than others, who got creative with their website design.</p>
